## Glossary

{:auto_ids}
0-based indexing
:   is a way of assigning indices to elements in a sequential, ordered data structure
    starting from 0, i.e. where the first element of the sequence has index 0.

CSV (file)
:   is an acronym which stands for Comma-Separated Values file. CSV files store
    tabular data, either numbers, strings, or a combination of the two, in plain
    text with columns separated by a comma and rows by the carriage return character.

database
:   is an organized collection of data.

dataframe
:   is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of (potentially)
    different type.

data structure
:   is a particular way of organizing data in memory.

data type
:   is a particular kind of item that can be assigned to a variable, defined by
    the values it can take, the programming language in use and the operations
    that can be performed on it.

dictionary
:   is an unordered Python data structure designed to contain key-value pairs, where both
    the key and the value can be integers, floats or strings. Elements of a dictionary
    can be accessed by their key and can be modified.

docstring
:   is an optional documentation string to describe what a Python function does.

faceting
:   is the act of plotting relationships between set variables in multiple subsets
    of the data with the results appearing as different panels in the same figure.

float
:   is a Python data type designed to store positive and negative decimal numbers
    by means of a floating point representation.

function
:   is a group of related statements that perform a specific task.

integer
:   is a Python data type designed to store positive and negative integer numbers.

interactive mode
:   is an online mode of operation in which the user writes the commands directly
    on the command line one-by-one and execute them immediately by pressing a button
    on the keyword, usually <kbd>Return</kbd>.

join key
:   is a variable or an array representing the column names over which pandas.DataFrame.join()
    merge together columns of different data sets.

library
:   is a set of functions and methods grouped together to perform some specific
    sort of tasks.

list
:   is a Python data structure designed to contain sequences of integers, floats,
    strings and any combination of the previous. The sequence is ordered and indexed
    by integers, starting from 0. Elements of a list can be accessed by their index
    and can be modified.

loop
:   is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a condition
    is satisfied.

NaN
:   is an acronym for Not-a-Number and represents that either a value is missing or
    the calculation cannot output any meaningful result.

None
:   is an object that represents no value.

scripting mode
:   is an offline mode of operation in which the user writes the commands to be
    executed in a text file (with .py extension for Python) which is then compiled
    or interpreted to run the program. Notes that Python interprets script on
    run-time and compiles a binary version of the program to speed up the execution time.

Sequential (data structure)
:   is an ordered group of objects stored in memory which can be accessed specifying
    their index, i.e. their position, in the structure.

SQL
:   or Structured Query Language, is a domain-specific language for managing data
    stored in a relational database management system (RDBMS).

SQLite
:   is a self-contained, public domain SQL database engine.

string
:   is a Python data type designed to store sequences of characters.

tuple
:   is a Python data structure designed to contain sequences of integers, floats,
    strings and any combination of the previous. The sequence is ordered and indexed
    by integers, starting from 0. Elements of a tuple can be accessed by their index
    but cannot be modified.

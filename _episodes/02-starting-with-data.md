# Working With Pandas DataFrames in Python

We can automate the process of performing data manipulations in Python. It's efficient to spend time
building the code to perform these tasks because once it's built, we can use it
over and over on different datasets that use a similar format. This makes our
methods easily reproducible. We can also easily share our code with colleagues
and they can replicate the same analysis.

### Starting in the same spot

To help the lesson run smoothly, let's ensure everyone is in the same directory.
This should help us avoid path and file name issues. At this time please
navigate to the workshop directory. If you are working in Jupyter Notebook be sure
that you start your notebook in the workshop directory.

A quick aside that there are Python libraries like [OS Library][os-lib] that can work with our
directory structure, however, that is not our focus today.

### Our Data

For this lesson, we will be using the Portal Teaching data, a subset of the data
from Ernst et al
[Long-term monitoring and experimental manipulation of a Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem near Portal,
Arizona, USA][ernst].

We will be using files from the [Portal Project Teaching Database][pptd].
This section will use the `surveys.csv` file that can be downloaded here:
[https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292172][figshare-ndownloader]

We are studying the species and weight of animals caught in sites in our study
area. The dataset is stored as a `.csv` file: each row holds information for a
single animal, and the columns represent:

| Column           | Description                        |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| record_id        | Unique id for the observation      |
| month            | month of observation               |
| day              | day of observation                 |
| year             | year of observation                |
| plot_id          | ID of a particular site            |
| species_id       | 2-letter code                      |
| sex              | sex of animal ("M", "F")           |
| hindfoot_length  | length of the hindfoot in mm       |
| weight           | weight of the animal in grams      |


The first few rows of our first file look like this:

~~~
record_id,month,day,year,plot_id,species_id,sex,hindfoot_length,weight
1,7,16,1977,2,NL,M,32,

## About Libraries
A library in Python contains a set of tools (called functions) that perform
tasks on our data. Importing a library is like getting a piece of lab equipment
out of a storage locker and setting it up on the bench for use in a project.
Once a library is set up, it can be used or called to perform the task(s)
it was built to do.

## Pandas in Python
One of the best options for working with tabular data in Python is to use the
[Python Data Analysis Library][pandas] (a.k.a. Pandas). The
Pandas library provides data structures, produces high quality plots with
[matplotlib][matplotlib] and integrates nicely with other libraries
that use [NumPy][numpy] (which is another Python library) arrays.

Python doesn't load all of the libraries available to it by default. We have to
add an `import` statement to our code in order to use library functions. To import
a library, we use the syntax `import libraryName`. If we want to give the
library a nickname to shorten the command, we can add `as nickNameHere`.  An
example of importing the pandas library using the common nickname `pd` is below.


~~~
import pandas as pd
~~~
{: .language-python}

Each time we call a function that's in a library, we use the syntax
`LibraryName.FunctionName`. Adding the library name with a `.` before the
function name tells Python where to find the function. In the example above, we
have imported Pandas as `pd`. This means we don't have to type out `pandas` each
time we call a Pandas function.


# Reading CSV Data Using Pandas

We will begin by locating and reading our survey data which are in CSV format. CSV stands for
Comma-Separated Values and is a common way to store formatted data. Other symbols may also be used, so
you might see tab-separated, colon-separated or space separated files. It is quite easy to replace
one separator with another, to match your application. The first line in the file often has headers
to explain what is in each column. CSV (and other separators) make it easy to share data, and can be
imported and exported from many applications, including Microsoft Excel. For more details on CSV
files, see the [Data Organisation in Spreadsheets][spreadsheet-lesson5] lesson.
We can use Pandas' `read_csv` function to pull the file directly into a [DataFrame][pd-dataframe].

## So What's a DataFrame?

A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional data structure that can store data of different
types (including characters, integers, floating point values, factors and more)
in columns. It is similar to a spreadsheet or an SQL table or the `data.frame` in
R. A DataFrame always has an index (0-based). An index refers to the position of
an element in the data structure.

~~~
# Note that pd.read_csv is used because we imported pandas as pd
pd.read_csv("data/surveys.csv")
~~~
{: .language-python}

The above command yields the **output** below:

~~~
record_id  month  day  year  plot_id species_id sex  hindfoot_length  weight

[35549 rows x 9 columns]
~~~
{: .output}

We can see that there were 35,549 rows parsed. Each row has 9
columns. The first column is the index of the DataFrame. The index is used to
identify the position of the data, but it is not an actual column of the DataFrame.
It looks like  the `read_csv` function in Pandas  read our file properly. However,
we haven't saved any data to memory so we can work with it. We need to assign the
DataFrame to a variable. Remember that a variable is a name for a value, such as `x`,
or  `data`. We can create a new  object with a variable name by assigning a value to it using `=`.

Let's call the imported survey data `surveys_df`:

~~~
surveys_df = pd.read_csv("data/surveys.csv")
~~~
{: .language-python}

Notice when you assign the imported DataFrame to a variable, Python does not
produce any output on the screen.  The IPython package includes the display() function, which is preferable to pandas over print(). We can view the value of the `surveys_df`
object by typing:

~~~
from IPython.display import display

display(surveys_df)
~~~
{: .language-python}

which prints contents like above.

Note: if the output is too wide to print on your narrow terminal window, you may see something
slightly different as the large set of data scrolls past. You may see simply the last column
of data:

Never fear, all the data is there, if you scroll up. Selecting just a few rows, so it is
easier to fit on one window, you can see that pandas has neatly formatted the data to fit
our screen:

~~~
display(surveys_df.head()) # The head() method displays the first several lines of a file. It
                  # is discussed below.

7     NaN

## Exploring Our Species Survey Data

Again, we can use the `type` function to see what kind of thing `surveys_df` is:

~~~
type(surveys_df)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
~~~
{: .output}

As expected, it's a DataFrame (or, to use the full name that Python uses to refer
to it internally, a `pandas.core.frame.DataFrame`).

What kind of things does `surveys_df` contain? DataFrames have an attribute
called `dtypes` that answers this:

~~~
surveys_df.dtypes
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
record_id            int64
month                int64
day                  int64
year                 int64
plot_id              int64
species_id          object
sex                 object
hindfoot_length    float64
weight             float64
dtype: object
~~~
{: .output}

All the values in a column have the same type. For example, months have type
`int64`, which is a kind of integer. Cells in the month column cannot have
fractional values, but the weight and hindfoot_length columns can, because they
have type `float64`. The `object` type doesn't have a very helpful name, but in
this case it represents strings (such as 'M' and 'F' in the case of sex).

The datatypes can be adjusted in order to save memory for large data frames. The datatype `category` is useful for string variables consisting of only a few different values such as 'M' and 'F' in the case of sex. New datatypes can be assigned by:

~~~
new_types = {'record_id': 'int32', 'month': 'int16', 'day': 'int16', 'year': 'int16', 'plot_id': 'int16',
             'species_id' : 'object','sex': 'category', 'hindfoot_length': 'float32', 'weight': 'float32'}
surveys_df = surveys_df.astype(new_types)
display(surveys_df.dtypes)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
record_id             int32
month                 int16
day                   int16
year                  int16
plot_id               int16
species_id           object
sex                category
hindfoot_length     float32
weight              float32
dtype: object
~~~
{: .output}


We'll talk a bit more about what the different formats mean in a different lesson.

### Useful Ways to View DataFrame objects in Python

There are many ways to summarize and access the data stored in DataFrames,
using attributes and methods provided by the DataFrame object.

To access an attribute, use the DataFrame object name followed by the attribute
name `df_object.attribute`. Using the DataFrame `surveys_df` and attribute
`columns`, an index of all the column names in the DataFrame can be accessed
with `surveys_df.columns`.

Methods are called in a similar fashion using the syntax `df_object.method()`.
As an example, `surveys_df.head()` gets the first few rows in the DataFrame
`surveys_df` using **the `head()` method**. With a method, we can supply extra
information in the parens to control behaviour.

Let's look at the data using these.

## Calculating Statistics From Data In A Pandas DataFrame

We've read our data into Python. Next, let's perform some quick summary
statistics to learn more about the data that we're working with. We might want
to know how many animals were collected in each site, or how many of each
species were caught. We can perform summary stats quickly using groups. But
first we need to figure out what we want to group by.

Let's begin by exploring our data:

~~~
# Look at the column names
surveys_df.columns
~~~
{: .language-python}

which **returns**:

~~~
Index(['record_id', 'month', 'day', 'year', 'plot_id', 'species_id', 'sex',
       'hindfoot_length', 'weight'],
      dtype='object')
~~~
{: .output}

Let's get a list of all the species. The `pd.unique` function tells us all of
the unique values in the `species_id` column.

~~~
pd.unique(surveys_df['species_id'])
~~~
{: .language-python}

which **returns**:

~~~
array(['NL', 'DM', 'PF', 'PE', 'DS', 'PP', 'SH', 'OT', 'DO', 'OX', 'SS',
       'OL', 'RM', nan, 'SA', 'PM', 'AH', 'DX', 'AB', 'CB', 'CM', 'CQ',
       'RF', 'PC', 'PG', 'PH', 'PU', 'CV', 'UR', 'UP', 'ZL', 'UL', 'CS',
       'SC', 'BA', 'SF', 'RO', 'AS', 'SO', 'PI', 'ST', 'CU', 'SU', 'RX',
       'PB', 'PL', 'PX', 'CT', 'US'], dtype=object)
~~~
{: .output}

> ## Challenge - Statistics

{: .challenge}

# Groups in Pandas

We often want to calculate summary statistics grouped by subsets or attributes
within fields of our data. For example, we might want to calculate the average
weight of all individuals per site.

We can calculate basic statistics for all records in a single column using the
syntax below:

~~~
surveys_df['weight'].describe()
~~~
{: .language-python}
gives **output**

~~~
count    32283.000000
mean        42.672428
std         36.631259
min          4.000000
25%         20.000000
50%         37.000000
75%         48.000000
max        280.000000
Name: weight, dtype: float64
~~~
{: .language-python}

We can also extract one specific metric if we wish:

~~~
surveys_df['weight'].min()
surveys_df['weight'].max()
surveys_df['weight'].mean()
surveys_df['weight'].std()
surveys_df['weight'].count()
~~~
{: .language-python}

But if we want to summarize by one or more variables, for example sex, we can
use **Pandas' `.groupby` method**. Once we've created a groupby DataFrame, we
can quickly calculate summary statistics by a group of our choice.

~~~
# Group data by sex
grouped_data = surveys_df.groupby('sex')
~~~
{: .language-python}

The **pandas function `describe`** will return descriptive stats including: mean,
median, max, min, std and count for a particular column in the data. Pandas'
`describe` function will only return summary values for columns containing
numeric data.

~~~
# Summary statistics for all numeric columns by sex
display(grouped_data.describe())
# Provide the mean for each numeric column by sex
grouped_data.mean()
~~~
{: .language-python}

gives **output**

## Quickly Creating Summary Counts in Pandas

Let's next count the number of samples for each species. We can do this in a few
ways, but we'll use `groupby` combined with **a `count()` method**.

surveys_df.groupby('species_id')['record_id'].count()['DO']

## Basic Math Functions

If we wanted to, we could perform math on an entire column of our data. For
example let's multiply all weight values by 2. A more practical use of this might
be to normalize the data according to a mean, area, or some other value
calculated from our data.

~~~
# Multiply all weight values by 2
surveys_df['weight']*2
~~~
{: .language-python}

# Quick & Easy Plotting Data Using Pandas

We can plot our summary stats using Pandas, too.

~~~
# Make sure figures appear inline in Ipython Notebook
%matplotlib inline
# Create a quick bar chart
species_counts.plot(kind='bar');
~~~
{: .language-python}

![Weight by Species Site](../fig/countPerSpecies.png)
Count per species site

We can also look at how many animals were captured in each site:

~~~
total_count = surveys_df.groupby('plot_id')['record_id'].nunique()
# Let's plot that too
total_count.plot(kind='bar');
~~~

>> ## Solution to Summary Challenge
>>
>> First we group data by site and by sex, and then calculate a total for each site.
>>
>> ~~~
>> by_site_sex = surveys_df.groupby(['plot_id', 'sex'])
>> site_sex_count = by_site_sex['weight'].sum()
>> ~~~
>> {: .language-python}
>>
>> This calculates the sums of weights for each sex within each site as a table
>>
>> ~~~
>> site  sex
>> plot_id  sex
>> 1        F      38253
>>          M      59979
>> 2        F      50144
>>          M      57250
>> 3        F      27251
>>          M      28253
>> 4        F      39796
>>          M      49377
>> <other sites removed for brevity>
>> ~~~
>> {: .output}
>>
>> Below we'll use `.unstack()` on our grouped data to figure out the total weight that each sex contributed to each site.
>>
>> ~~~
>> by_site_sex = surveys_df.groupby(['plot_id', 'sex'])
>> site_sex_count = by_site_sex['weight'].sum()
>> site_sex_count.unstack()
>> ~~~
>> {: .language-python }
>>
>> The `unstack` method above will display the following output:
>>
>> ~~~
>> sex          F      M
>> plot_id
>> 1        38253  59979
>> 2        50144  57250
>> 3        27251  28253
>> 4        39796  49377
>> <other sites removed for brevity>
>> ~~~
>> {: .output}
>>
>> Now, create a stacked bar plot with that data where the weights for each sex are stacked by site.
>>
>> Rather than display it as a table, we can plot the above data by stacking the values of each sex as follows:
>>
>> ~~~
>> by_site_sex = surveys_df.groupby(['plot_id', 'sex'])
>> site_sex_count = by_site_sex['weight'].sum()
>> spc = site_sex_count.unstack()
>> s_plot = spc.plot(kind='bar', stacked=True, title="Total weight by site and sex")
>> s_plot.set_ylabel("Weight")
>> s_plot.set_xlabel("Plot")

## Glossary

[0-based indexing]{#based-indexing}
:   is a way of assigning indices to elements in a sequential, ordered data structure
starting from 0, i.e. where the first element of the sequence has index 0.

[CSV (file)]{#csv-file}
:   is an acronym which stands for Comma-Separated Values file. CSV files store
tabular data, either numbers, strings, or a combination of the two, in plain
text with columns separated by a comma and rows by the carriage return character.

[database]{#database}
:   is an organized collection of data.

[dataframe]{#dataframe}
:   is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of (potentially)
different type.

[data structure]{#data-structure}
:   is a particular way of organizing data in memory.

[data type]{#data-type}
:   is a particular kind of item that can be assigned to a variable, defined by
the values it can take, the programming language in use and the operations
that can be performed on it.

[dictionary]{#dictionary}
:   is a Python data structure designed to contain key-value pairs, where both
the key and the value can be integers, floats or strings. Elements of a dictionary
can be accessed by their key and can be modified.

[docstring]{#docstring}
:   is an optional documentation string to describe what a Python function does.

[faceting]{#faceting}
:   is the act of plotting relationships between set variables in multiple subsets
of the data with the results appearing as different panels in the same figure.

[float]{#float}
:   is a Python data type designed to store positive and negative decimal numbers
by means of a floating point representation.

[function]{#function}
:   is a group of related statements that perform a specific task.

[integer]{#integer}
:   is a Python data type designed to store positive and negative integer numbers.

[interactive mode]{#interactive-mode}
:   is an online mode of operation in which the user writes the commands directly
on the command line one-by-one and execute them immediately by pressing a button
on the keyword, usually <kbd>Return</kbd>.

[join key]{#join-key}
:   is a variable or an array representing the column names over which pandas.DataFrame.join()
merge together columns of different data sets.

[library]{#library}
:   is a set of functions and methods grouped together to perform some specific
sort of tasks.

[list]{#list}
:   is a Python data structure designed to contain sequences of integers, floats,
strings and any combination of the previous. The sequence is ordered and indexed
by integers, starting from 0. Elements of a list can be accessed by their index
and can be modified.

[loop]{#loop}
:   is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a condition
is satisfied.

[NaN]{#nan}
:   is an acronym for Not-a-Number and represents that either a value is missing or
the calculation cannot output any meaningful result.

[None]{#none}
:   is an object that represents no value.

[scripting mode]{#scripting-mode}
:   is an offline mode of operation in which the user writes the commands to be
executed in a text file (with .py extension for Python) which is then compiled
or interpreted to run the program. Notes that Python interprets script on
run-time and compiles a binary version of the program to speed up the execution time.

[Sequential (data structure)]{#sequential-data-structure}
:   is an ordered group of objects stored in memory which can be accessed specifying
their index, i.e. their position, in the structure.

[SQL]{#sql}
:   or Structured Query Language, is a domain-specific language for managing data
stored in a relational database management system (RDBMS).

[SQLite]{#sqlite}
:   is a self-contained, public domain SQL database engine.

[string]{#string}
:   is a Python data type designed to store sequences of characters.

[tuple]{#tuple}
:   is a Python data structure designed to contain sequences of integers, floats,
strings and any combination of the previous. The sequence is ordered and indexed
by integers, starting from 0. Elements of a tuple can be accessed by their index
but cannot be modified.
